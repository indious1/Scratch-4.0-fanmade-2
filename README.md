This is fan-made. Scratch has no idea this is happening. This is by users of Scratch and nobody that works at scratch.mit.edu

If you would like to join making the fan-made project, (anyone is free to ask) please reach out to the owner of the repository at scratch.mit.edu/users/INDIOUS111. Remember, you are free to ask to join whenever.

There will be more to add to this repository later in the future, and this is just the beginning of what could be a huge project with many Scratchers.
