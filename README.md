# Scratch4.0

### We are trying to develop a fourth version of Scratch with more features.

#### Database: SQLite for development, then switch to PostgreSQL
#### Web-Framework: Flask
#### Frontend: HTML/TailwindCSS

## I am insane at making backends and database managment so I got our DB schema and API



Some New Feature Ideas:
- Live, Multiplayer Collab
- Better Cloud Data Limits
- Better Filtering
- Python Support
- Access to some websites data (eliminates some uses of things like scratchattach, sorry @1tim)
- Package Index for Scratch
- Better UI
- Notifications
- Live chat (like discord)
- Green Flag converts project to javascript for no glitching
- Built in scratchstats and scratch addons
- Sign-in as your scratch account
- Color Themes
- Better Tutorials
